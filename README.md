## About

This is the course repository for the course **Advanced Statistical
Methods: Bayesian Statistics** at the University of Sussex, School of
Psychology. 

This course covers the basics of Bayesian statistics with a focus of Bayes
factors. Bayes factors are computed using the `bayesplay` package in `R`.

The `bayesplay` package can be installed from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.pacakges("bayesplay")
```

Additionally, analyses can be performed with the **Bayesplay-Web** app,
which is available at
[bayesplay.mindsci.net](https://bayesplay.mindsci.net).

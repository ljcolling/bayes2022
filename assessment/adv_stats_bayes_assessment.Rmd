# Part 1 

A researcher was interested in whether there is a gender difference in
maths anxiety scores. They predict women would have higher scores than
men. They measure maths anxiety using the aMAS score (which assigns scores
from 9 to 45). The data they find is available on `amas.csv` on canvas. The
researcher expects to see this difference because previous studies have
shown that on average there is a difference of 5.5 points between men and
women. The researcher decides to analyse their data in several ways. 

1.  With a uniform prior (on H1) ranging from the minimum possible difference
    between the two groups to the maximum possible difference between the two
    groups 

2.  With a half-normal prior (on H1) centered at zero and scaled according
    to the estimate (of 5.5) obtained from the previous literature. 

3.  Using a "default" prior (on H1).

For the null hypothesis (H0) they decide to use a point null at 0. Carry
out the analyses as specified above. 

For each analysis you should specify the likelihood and the priors and
calculate the corresponding Bayes factors. Provide an interpretation of
the results. You can include any plots you think are relevant, and you
should include all the corresponding R code. 

# Part 2 

Choose one finding from the literature in an area of your interest. Pick a
finding that has employed a frequentist test (for example, a *t*-test) and
provide a Bayesian re-analysis of the result. You can choose any priors you
think are appropriate. However, you should provide some explanation of your
reasoning.

Compare the results of the frequentist test to your Bayesian re-analysis.
You can include any plots you think are relevant, and you should include
all the corresponding R code. 


# Some useful formulas

## Calculate the effect size for the one sample case

$$d = \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}},$$

where $\mathrm{m}$ is the mean of the sample, and $\mathrm{s}$ is the estimate
of the population $\sigma$ that has been calculated from the sample.

## Calculate the effect size for the two sample case


$$d = \frac{\mathrm{m}_1 - \mathrm{m}_2}{\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{pooled}},$$

where $\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{pooled}$ is given as follows:

$$\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(\mathrm{n}_1 - 1)\mathrm{s}^2_1 + (\mathrm{n}_2 - 1)\mathrm{s}^2_2}{\mathrm{n}_1 + \mathrm{n}_2 - 2}},$$

## Calculate the standard error (standard deviation of the mean)

$$\mathrm{se} = \frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{\sqrt{n}}},$$

Where $\mathrm{n}$ is the sample size.

## Calculate the standard error for two groups

$$\mathrm{se} = \mathrm{s}_\mathrm{pooled} \cdot{} \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{\mathrm{n}_1} + \tfrac{1}{\mathrm{n}_2}}$$

## Calculate the standard error from a *t* value

$$t=\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{se}}$$

# Some useful `R` functions 

## Compute the mean of a vector of numbers `x`.

```r
mean(x)
```

## Compute the standard deviation of a vector of numbers `x`

```r
sd(x)
```

## Compute the effect size of the difference between groups

If you have data arranged as follows:

| Subject ID  | Group ID  | Value  |
|-------------|---------- |--------|
| 01          | group 1   | 4      |
| 02          | group 2   | 7      |

Where the data is in a tibble called `df`, the group id column is labelled `f`,
and the column holding the values is labelled `x`, then the effect size can be
computed with the `effsize` package as follows.

```r
effsize::cohen.d(df$x, df$f)$estimate
```

Remember to ensure that the package is installed before using it.

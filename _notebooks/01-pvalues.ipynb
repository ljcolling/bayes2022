    "# Null-hypothesis significance testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into Bayesian hypothesis testing, it's worth spending a little\n",
    "time going over Frequentist null-hypothesis significance testing. The reason\n",
    "for this is that I want it to be clear that Bayesian methods and Frequentist\n",
    "methods aren't just two different ways of answering the same question. Rather,\n",
    "I want it to be clear that Bayesian methods and Frequentist methods are asking\n",
    "**fundamentally different questions**. For this reason, we'll start right back\n",
    "at the beginning with *p* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Statistical Association (ASA) defines a *p* value as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical\n",
    "> summary of the data (e.g., the sample mean difference between two compared\n",
    "> groups) would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value\n",
    "> ([Wasserstein and Lazar 2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108))\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a perfectly acceptable definition, it is maybe a little tricky to\n",
    "understand. The main reason for this is that the definition contains at least\n",
    "one *ill-defined concept* (\"probability\") and one tricky concept (\"specified\n",
    "statistical model\"). To understand what a *p* value really is, we're going to\n",
    "have to unpack both of these ideas. Along the way, we're going to learn about\n",
    "some other concepts that will also help us understand *Frequentist* inference.\n",
    "And a good grounding in Frequentist inference will also help us understand the\n",
    "distinction between Frequentist inference and Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people think of *probability* as a mathematical concept. In a sense it is,\n",
    "but it is also a deeply *philosophical* concept. We deploy the word\n",
    "*probability* in many different *kinds* of situations, and it's not clear\n",
    "whether we mean the same thing in each of them. Some examples of where we use\n",
    "the word probability are when we ask questions like: What is the probability of\n",
    "getting heads on repeated tosses of a fair coin? What is the probability that\n",
    "it will rain tomorrow? What is the probability the accused committed the crime?\n",
    "The word *probability* seemingly refers to different things in each of these\n",
    "situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might suggest that the probability of the getting heads is 0.5,\n",
    "where this 0.5 refers to the *long-run relative frequency* of getting heads.\n",
    "That is, if we were to toss a coin many many times then on around 0.5 (i.e.,\n",
    "half) of the tosses the coin would come up heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might use a different notion when thinking about the case of somebody\n",
    "accused of a crime. We might say something like, \"we are 90% sure\" (probability\n",
    "of .9) that the criminal committed the crime. But what does \"90% sure\" mean.\n",
    "Does it make sense to think of it as the *relative frequency*? If not, then how\n",
    "else might we think of it? We might, for example, think of it as a *credence*\n",
    "or a *degree of belief* that the proposition is true. Or we might think of it\n",
    "as a *degree of support*. That is, we might say that the available evidence\n",
    "supports the hypothesis that the accused committed the crime with odds of\n",
    "9-to-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list isn't meant to be exhaustive. The aim is just to highlight that we\n",
    "might sometimes mean different things when we think about probability. It pays\n",
    "to keep this in mind as we move through the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability and *p* values\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know that *probability* can mean different things in different\n",
    "situations, what notion of *probability* is at play in ASA's definition of the\n",
    "*p* value? The common view is to say that it refers to *relative frequencies*.\n",
    "But relative frequencies of **what** over repeats of **what**?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could possibly re-phrase that definition to say something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> the p value refers to the relative frequency of obtaining a statistical\n",
    "> summary of the data as large or larger than the observed value over\n",
    "> hypothetical repeats of an experiment described by a specified statistical\n",
    "> model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the *p* through simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "One method that I think is useful for understanding statistical concept is\n",
    "*simulation*. This is particularly true in the case of *p*-values, because I\n",
    "definition above refers to *hypothetical repeats*. Simulation means that we can\n",
    "just simulate those *repeats*. To understand how *p* values work, let's start\n",
    "with a little scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You've been given a device that can be used to find buried treasure. The\n",
    "> device has a numbered dial on it, and there is a little arrow that can point\n",
    "> at these numbers. The indicator never stays still, but swings around a bit.\n",
    "> You don't know how the device works, except that it behaves *differently*\n",
    "> around treasure compared with when there is no treasure present. How can you\n",
    "> use this device to find treasure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a hard problem. You know very little about the device. You\n",
    "don't know what it's meant to do when it finds treasure, and you don't know\n",
    "what it's meant to do when there isn't any treasure. So how do you go about\n",
    "using it to find treasure?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding treasure\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using the device is to get a good description of what it does\n",
    "when there isn't any treasure around. To do this, you might just take your\n",
    "device somewhere without treasure. You can then just sit and watch the dial.\n",
    "After a long time watching it, you might notice that although the pointer\n",
    "swings around a lot, *on average* it points at zero. This one bit of\n",
    "information is enough to develop a treasure hunting strategy using this device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the strategy is deciding how many readings to take on each\n",
    "hunt. Because the pointer swings around a lot, we'll need to take a couple of\n",
    "readings and then use these to work out an average (which we'll call\n",
    "$\\bar{x}$). We're in a hurry so we'll take **10** readings on each hunt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll need to scale our average. If our average is 1, then is this close\n",
    "to 0? How about 0.5? Or 5? Or 15? It's impossible to know because you don't\n",
    "know range of the average dial's swings. So your scaling factor should be\n",
    "proportional to the magnitude of the average deviations you've observed (we'll\n",
    "call this scaling factor $s_{\\bar{x}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information in hand, we have enough to build a statistical model of\n",
    "our device's behaviour. To do this, we just go where there is no treasure and\n",
    "perform the following steps: 1) Take 10 readings; 2) work out an average\n",
    "($\\bar{x}$); 3) scale it by our scaling factor ($s_{\\bar{x}}$); write down our\n",
    "scaled measurement (which we'll call $t$), and repeat! Once we've done this\n",
    "many many times, then we'll have a nice distribution or statistical model of\n",
    "how our device behaves when there isn't any treasure. Of course, we don't have\n",
    "to do this for real. We can just simulate it! Feel free to play around with the\n",
    "simulation, to change the numbers, and to see how this influences our\n",
    "statistical model."

    "whether our data is surprising** or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, our treasure-hunting scenario may not be exactly analogous to how\n",

    "### A short note on confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll mention confidence intervals only briefly, but they follow the *exact*\n",
    "same logic as *p*-values. Let’s say I collect some measurements, work out the\n",
    "average. I could scale this value with my scaling factor, could get a *t*\n",
    "value. I could then turn to my list of results from the pretend experiments\n",

    "\n",
    "How could we do this? Looking at the sampling distribution we constructed\n",
    "earlier we would see that values that are more than about 2.23 *t* units from 0\n",
    "would be surprising. Using this information, I can ask myself the following\n",
    "question: If my device on average pointed at the current sample average, rather\n",
    "than zero, what data values would be surprising? The answer to this is, of\n",
    "course, values that are more than 2.23 *t* units from the sample mean. Having\n",
    "an answer in *t* units isn't very useful. But I know that I converted\n",
    "measurements to *t* units by scaling readings using the scaling factor\n",
    "$s_{\\bar{x}}$. This means we can just un-scale the value in *t* units back into\n",
    "raw units using the scaling factor calculated from my sample. This means I can\n",
    "say that any values $\\pm 2.23\\cdot{}s_{\\bar{x}}$ from the sample mean would be\n",
    "surprising. Any values less than this, or in this range, would be unsurprising\n",
    "if my device, on average, pointed at my current sample mean. I could draw a\n",
    "line through these values, put little tails on this line, and *hey presto* I\n",
    "have a confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now just to be clear, just like with a *p* value, a confidence interval tells\n",
    "you what values would be surprising/unsurprising on an assumption of a certain\n",
    "value of the parameter. For the *p* value you set the parameter to 0 (or\n",
    "wherever else the device points when no treasure is around). For the confidence\n",
    "interval, I just set the parameter value to the estimate obtained from the\n",
    "current sample, but it’s exactly the same idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, this should make it clear what the confidence interval does and\n",
    "doesn't tell you. It doesn't tell you about the *probability of a parameter\n",
    "falling within a range* (the common misinterpretation). It tells you *frequency\n",

    "the assumption that the parameter is equal to the observed value*. At no point\n",
    "are we making inferences about **parameters** or **true values** of parameters.\n",
    "We are holding parameters constant, doing pretend experiments, and then marking\n",
    "out the range of surprising and unsurprising data. \n",

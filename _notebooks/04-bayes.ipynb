    "computed a Bayes factor. The Bayes factor is just the ratio that we computed in\n",

    "probability of obtaining our data under one model compared to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we computed these ratios, the Bayes factor, in the previous section, it was\n",
    "made up of two ingredients. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We had our likelihood that related parameter values to our data. It told\n",
    "us the relative probability of obtaining our data under different values of the\n",
    "the parameter (the coin bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We had priors, which assigned different probabilities to the different values\n",
    "of the parameter. These served as our hypotheses about the parameter (the coin\n",
    "bias), and they served as the *weights* for our average of the likelihood. \n",
    "We had one prior for each hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the computation itself, we multiplied the prior by the likelihood,\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{M}_H = \\int_{\\theta\\in\\Theta_H}\\mathcal{L}_H(\\theta|\\mathbf{y})p(\\theta)d\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We did this for each hypothesis (e.g., $\\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\\mathcal{M}_1$),\n",
    "and then took the ratio $\\frac{\\mathcal{M}_0}{\\mathcal{M}_1}$. And this ratio\n",

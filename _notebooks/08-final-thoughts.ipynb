    "# Final thoughts: Uncertainty and belief\n",

    "Before we finish I just wanted to leave you with some final thoughts about\n",
    "uncertainty. Uncertainty is everywhere in science, but as scientists we are\n",
    "often reluctant to admit it. Maybe this is partly due to a fear of how\n",
    "uncertainty will be exploited, for example, in the case of scepticism about\n",
    "human induced climate change or the efficacy of vaccines. However, there's no\n",
    "getting away from the reality that the things we believe for certain to be true\n",
    "today may turn out to be, at best, incomplete pictures of how the world works\n",
    "and, at worst, wholly false.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, rather than shying away from uncertainty, I think it is better to\n",
    "embrace it, and to be upfront about it. In this section, I wanted to briefly\n",
    "touch on two aspects of uncertainty. The first, has to do with uncertainty\n",
    "in our statistical models, specifically the priors that we use in our\n",
    "analyses. And the second has to do with evidence and belief. Given some\n",
    "evidence from our statistical analysis, how do we know what we should\n",
    "believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uncertainty about priors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples in the preceding sections, we often set one prior for our\n",
    "alternative hypothesis. For example, we might have used a specific Cauchy\n",
    "distribution---that is, a Cauchy distribution centred at 0, with a specific\n",
    "scale factor. But this decision is not the only decision we could have\n",
    "made. We could've chosen a different scale factor. Maybe we're not sure if\n",
    "we're expecting large effect sizes or medium effect sizes so we're unsure\n",
    "about exactly which scale factor we should pick. We just don't know what\n",
    "the **one true prior** is. This probably is made worse by the fact that\n",
    "choosing a different prior might lead to a different result. We can see\n",
    "just such a case in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we can see two analyses of the same data. First\n",
    "the analysis is performed with a Cauchy prior with a scale factor of 2."
